## Demo
print("Welcome to Treasure Island.")
print("Your mission is to find the treasure.")

junction1 = input("You are now on you way to find your treasure and reach the first junction on the map. Which direction to take type R for right and L for left: ").upper()
if junction1 == "L":
    print("You are on the right track.")
else:
    print("Game Over - You have fallen into a whole and cannot get out.")

junction2 = input("You have reach a river that is about 200 ft in width and you are a good swimmer.  Type 'W' for wait or 'S' to swim: ").upper()
if junction2 == "W":
    print(" You have made it across safely. Keep going you are getting closer")
else:
    print("Attacked by Trouts - Game Over")
    
building = input("You have reached the building on the map that has the treasure. There are 3 doors each with different colours. Type 'R'to choose the red door, or type 'B' to choose the blue door, or 'Y' to choose the yellow door: ").upper()
if building == "R":
    print("Burned by fire - Game Over")
elif building == "B":
    print("Eated by beast - Game over")
elif building == "Y":
    print("You win - The treasure is yours")
else:
    print("Game over")

## Tech Stack
Itâ€™s created using Python, which is a high-level, interpreted programming language. Python is known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it a great choice for beginners who are just starting to learn programming.

In this game, the built-in print() function is used to display messages to the user, and the input() function is used to get input from the user. The if, elif, and else statements are used to control the flow of the game based on the userâ€™s choices.
## Documentation
Here are some resources that you can refer to for creating the game:

1. [Python For Beginners | Python.org](^1^): This is the official Python website's guide for beginners. It provides a brief tutorial that gives you basic information about the language and gets you started. You can follow this by looking at the library reference for a full description of Python's many libraries and the language reference for a complete explanation of Python's syntax.

2. [The Python Tutorial â€” Python 3.11.5 documentation](^2^): This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.

3. [Python Tutorial - W3Schools](^3^): W3Schools offers an interactive Python tutorial with a "Try it Yourself" editor, where you can edit Python code and view the result.

These resources cover the basics of Python programming, including syntax, data types, control structures (like if-else statements), and input/output, which are all you need to create a text-based adventure game like the one you posted.

## Lessons Learned
-  How to calculate portfolio daily returns.
Creating a text-based adventure game like this in Python can provide several valuable lessons:

1. **Understanding Basic Python Syntax**: This includes learning how to use print statements, variables, and the input function.

2. **Control Flow**: You'll get hands-on experience with Python's control flow tools, including if-else statements. These are fundamental to many types of programming tasks.

3. **User Interaction**: This game involves getting input from the user and responding accordingly, which is a common requirement in software development.

4. **Problem Solving**: Creating a game like this requires you to think logically and solve problems, such as how to guide the user through the game and respond to their choices.

5. **Creativity**: Designing a game allows you to be creative in terms of the storyline, challenges, and outcomes you create for the player.

6. **Debugging**: As with any programming project, you'll likely encounter bugs that you'll need to figure out how to fix. This is a valuable skill in all of software development.

Remember, the key to learning programming is practice! The more games or projects you create, the more comfortable you'll become with programming concepts and the Python language.
