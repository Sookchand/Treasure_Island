No additional libraries or frameworks were used in this particular code snippet. However, if you wanted to expand this game, you might consider using a library like curses for more advanced console output, or even porting your game to a graphical framework like pygame. But for a simple text-based game like this, plain Python is all you need."],"metadata":{"id":"w51m2PP7JhTq"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"-RImwzfGJkNM"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
